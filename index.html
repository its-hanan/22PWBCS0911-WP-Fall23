        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Abdul Hannan, and I proudly call Dir my hometown. I completed my Matriculation at Al-Huda Model
            School. Subsequently, I pursued my FSc in Pre-Engineering from Islamia College Peshawar.
            My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in the field of Pre-Engineering.

            Outside of my studies, I'm deeply passionate about art, particularly drawing and calligraphy, which I find
            incredibly fulfilling and enjoyable. My artistic skills have been a significant part of my life.

            Initially, I aspired to become an architectural engineer due to my love for drawing and sketching, but I've
            recently made the decision to pursue computer science as my future field of study. My future goal is to
            continue my studies in computer science to explore this exciting field further.

            I look forward to engaging with like-minded individuals in this field and learning together. If you'd like
            to discuss anything related to art, computer science, or anything else, please feel free to reach out.</p>
